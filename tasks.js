// so I was like why not just make a tasks file, and now we're here.
// TODO [] Test out this task list
// TODO [] Add more tasks
// TODO [] review other tasks

// [ ] Remove the types for now
// [ ] Fix alignment of chibipal selection

// Three real taks for now:
// [ ] Make palGenerator

// [ ] Add in depth to combat

// [ ] Add in pal catching
// [ ] Add in pal entering/leaving
