## Roguelike Monster Catching RPG

Welcome to **card-game-fun**—an imaginative spin on the classic deck-building game inspired by *Slay The Spire*. Developed using the power of React hooks, this project is a personal sandbox where I, p0cket, experiment with game mechanics and interface design.

Welcome to the **Roguelike Monster Catching RPG**—a thrilling adventure where the depths of dungeons are riddled with monsters to catch and challenges to overcome. Utilizing a unique blend of roguelike elements and monster collection mechanics, this game invites players into a procedurally generated world brimming with surprises.

### Features

- **Procedural Generation**: Every run is different with dynamically created dungeons.
- **Monster Catching**: Discover and capture a wide variety of monsters each with unique abilities.
- **Strategic Battles**: Engage in turn-based combat where strategy is key.
- **Character Progression**: Level up your character and monsters to unlock new skills.
- **Permadeath**: Experience the high stakes of roguelikes with permadeath, encouraging careful gameplay.

Currently in its early stages, **card-game-fun** may exhibit some quirky behavior, but that's all part of the journey! Each update brings us closer to a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.

### How to Get Started

To dive into the game:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
