Hey y'all, p0cket here.

This is my fun messing around, trying to do my own take on Slay The Spire using React hooks and not much else.

I'm sure it is super glitchy right now, but you can see the progress as it evolves over time.

I hope y'all enjoy!


Download, use `npm i` , and then `npm start` and you should be up and running :)
