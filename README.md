# card-game-fun
## Summary

Welcome to **card-game-fun**â€”an imaginative spin on the classic deck-building game inspired by *Slay The Spire*. Developed using the power of React hooks, this project is a personal sandbox where I, p0cket, experiment with game mechanics and interface design.

Currently in its early stages, **card-game-fun** may exhibit some quirky behavior, but that's all part of the journey! Each update brings us closer to a smooth and engaging gameplay experience.

### How to Get Started

To dive into the game:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the game with `npm start` and embark on your adventure.

Feel free to follow the progress, suggest changes, or fork the project to create your own version. Let's build something amazing together!

--keep being awesome--
